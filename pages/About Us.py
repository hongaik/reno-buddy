## Project Scope

To most homeowners, renovation is an exciting opportunity to transform their living space into a personalized and comfortable home, but it can also be a complex process filled with regulations, decisions, and challenges. Even for experienced contractors, remembering the nitty gritties of all the policies is close to impossible.

To help homeowners and contractors achieve their vision yet adhere to regulations, Taketa was developed to provide detailed and up-to-date answers to questions relating to HDB's renovation regulations. Its knowledge base spans a wide range of topics, including:

- Renovation approval processes
- Permitted and prohibited works
- Application procedures for renovation permits
- Guidelines for specific types of renovations (e.g., kitchens, bathrooms, electrical works)
- Contractor and licensing requirements
- Noise and work-hour regulations
- Fire safety and structural integrity guidelines

The assistant is available 24/7 and can handle queries through a user-friendly interface, making information easily accessible without the need for manual browsing through dense documents.

## Objectives

Taketa's primary objectives are:

- **Increase Accessibility**: Simplify access to complex renovation guidelines, making it easier for users to get answers without reading through multiple documents or visiting several websites.
- **Provide Accurate Information**: Leverage official and reliable data sources to ensure that responses are accurate, up-to-date, and relevant to the userâ€™s needs.
- **Improve User Experience**: Offer a smooth and intuitive interaction where users can quickly ask their questions and receive precise, easy-to-understand answers.
- **Reduce Manual Inquiries**: Help reduce the volume of inquiries directed to customer service by providing an automated, self-serve solution.
